from urllib.request import urlopen
'''
urllib is a standard Python library (meaning you donâ€™t have to install anything extra
to run this example) and contains functions for requesting data across the web, handling
cookies, and even changing metadata such as headers and your user agent. We
will be using urllib extensively throughout the book, so I recommend you read the
Python documentation for the library.
